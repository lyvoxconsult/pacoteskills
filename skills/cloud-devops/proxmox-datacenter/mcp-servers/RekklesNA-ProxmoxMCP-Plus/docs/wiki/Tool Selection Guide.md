# Tool Selection Guide

Use this page when you know the operational goal but are not sure which ProxmoxMCP-Plus tool path to use.

## Start With Discovery

Run read-only tools before mutating anything:

| Goal | Read-only tools |
| --- | --- |
| Check cluster health | `get_nodes`, `get_cluster_status` |
| Find VMs | `get_vms`, `get_vm_config` |
| Find containers | `get_containers`, `get_container_config`, `get_container_ip` |
| Check storage | `get_storage` |
| Check snapshots | `list_snapshots` with `vm_type=qemu` or `vm_type=lxc` |
| Check jobs | `list_jobs`, `get_job` |
| Check logs | `get_node_syslog`, `get_cluster_log` |

Discovery confirms node names, VMIDs, storage IDs, guest status, and whether the tool is visible in the connected client.

## Limit Tool Schema Exposure

Operators that need only a subset of the catalog can set `mcp.tool_allowlist` or
`MCP_TOOL_ALLOWLIST`. To hide a smaller set instead, use `mcp.tool_denylist` or
`MCP_TOOL_DENYLIST`. Filtering is disabled when neither mode is configured, preserving
the complete available tool surface for existing users. Configure only one mode and use
the exact lowercase names shown in this guide. Restart the server and reconnect the MCP
client after changing the selection.

Tool filtering keeps hidden schemas out of `tools/list`, reducing client context usage.
It does not grant Proxmox permissions or replace API-token least privilege.

## VM Workflows

| Operator goal | Tool sequence | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create a VM | `get_nodes` -> `get_storage` -> `create_vm` -> `poll_job` | `get_vms` or `get_vm_config` |
| Start or stop a VM | `get_vms` -> `start_vm` or `stop_vm` -> `poll_job` | `get_vms` |
| Delete a VM | `get_vms` -> snapshot or backup if needed -> `delete_vm` -> `poll_job` | `get_vms` |
| Run a guest command | `get_vms` -> `execute_vm_command` | command output and guest-agent status |

VM command execution requires QEMU Guest Agent inside the VM.

## Container Workflows

| Operator goal | Tool sequence | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create an LXC | `get_nodes` -> `get_storage` -> `create_container` -> `poll_job` | `get_containers` |
| Start or stop an LXC | `get_containers` -> `start_container` or `stop_container` -> `poll_job` | `get_containers` |
| Delete an LXC | `get_containers` -> snapshot or backup if needed -> `delete_container` -> `poll_job` | `get_containers` |
| Execute a command in an LXC | `get_containers` -> `execute_container_command` | command output |
| Update container SSH keys | `get_containers` -> `update_container_ssh_keys` | inspect authorized keys inside the container |

Container command execution appears only when the config has an `ssh` section. It SSHes to the Proxmox node and uses `pct exec`, so treat it as a separate security decision.

## Snapshot And Rollback Workflows

| Operator goal | Tool sequence | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prepare for a risky change | `list_snapshots` -> `create_snapshot` -> `poll_job` | `list_snapshots` |
| Roll back a VM or LXC | `list_snapshots` -> `rollback_snapshot` -> `poll_job` | guest status and `list_snapshots` |
| Clean old snapshots | `list_snapshots` -> `delete_snapshot` -> `poll_job` | `list_snapshots` |

Use snapshots before testing destructive tool flows in a lab.

## Backup And Restore Workflows

| Operator goal | Tool sequence | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create a backup | `get_storage` -> `create_backup` -> `poll_job` | backup list or storage contents |
| Restore a backup | `get_storage` -> select backup artifact -> `restore_backup` -> `poll_job` | VM or LXC status |
| Delete a backup | inspect backup metadata -> `delete_backup` | backup list |

Backup and restore operations are long-running Proxmox tasks. Use `job_id` for user-facing tracking and `task_id` for Proxmox-level traceability.

## ISO And Template Workflows

| Operator goal | Tool sequence | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Download an ISO | `get_storage` -> `download_iso` -> `poll_job` | storage contents |
| Delete an ISO | inspect storage contents -> `delete_iso` | storage contents |
| Create an LXC from template | `get_storage` -> confirm template exists -> `create_container` -> `poll_job` | container status |

Check storage content support before downloading ISOs or using templates.

## Job Tracking Workflows

Most mutating Proxmox operations return:

- `task_id`: the raw Proxmox `UPID`
- `job_id`: the persistent ProxmoxMCP-Plus job record

Use the job tools this way:

| Situation | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| User asks for recent work | `list_jobs` |
| User asks about one operation | `get_job` |
| You need fresh Proxmox task status | `poll_job` |
| A retryable operation failed | inspect `get_job`, then `retry_job` |
| A running task should stop | `cancel_job` |

Keep `jobs.sqlite_path` on durable storage when the deployment should preserve job history across restarts.

## Log Inspection Workflows

All log tools are read-only and safe to run at any time:

| Operator goal | Tool sequence | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Investigate a node problem | `get_node_syslog` with `since`/`until` filters | narrowed log window around the incident |
| Find out why a task failed | `get_task_log` with the task's `UPID` | task log output and exit status lines |
| Audit recent cluster activity | `get_cluster_log` | cluster-wide event history |
| Debug firewall behavior | `get_node_firewall_log` or `get_guest_firewall_log` | ACCEPT/DROP entries for the traffic in question |

`get_task_log` accepts any Proxmox task `UPID`, including tasks started outside this server. Use `poll_job` instead when you are tracking a `job_id` created by a mutating tool.

## OpenAPI Workflows

Use OpenAPI when a client cannot speak MCP:

1. Start the OpenAPI bridge.
2. Check `/livez`.
3. Send bearer auth to `/health` or `/readyz`.
4. Inspect `/openapi.json`.
5. Use generated tool routes and `/jobs` routes from the schema.

The OpenAPI bridge is not the native MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint. MCP HTTP clients should connect to `/mcp` on the service running on port `8000`.

## Safety Checklist Before Mutating

- Confirm the Proxmox API token has the required permissions and no more than necessary.
- Confirm the node, storage, VMID, and guest status from read-only tools.
- Confirm TLS verification settings are intentional.
- Confirm command policy and approval-token settings before using command tools.
- Confirm a snapshot or backup exists before risky changes.
- Confirm the user expects a real Proxmox mutation, not a dry-run explanation.
