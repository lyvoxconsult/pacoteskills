# Operator Guide

This guide covers how to configure, run, and operate ProxmoxMCP-Plus.

## Runtime Modes

ProxmoxMCP-Plus can be used in two main ways:

- `MCP stdio mode`: assistants launch the server directly and call tools over MCP
- `MCP Streamable HTTP mode`: the server exposes a native MCP endpoint at `/mcp`
- `OpenAPI mode`: FastAPI wraps the MCP server and exposes HTTP endpoints for other clients

The core tool set is the same in both modes. The difference is only the transport.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Access to a Proxmox VE API endpoint
- A Proxmox API token with the permissions your workflows need
- Network access from the machine running ProxmoxMCP-Plus to the Proxmox API

Optional:

- SSH access from the MCP host to Proxmox nodes if you want LXC command execution tools

## Configuration File

The main config file is `proxmox-config/config.json`.

Start from the example:

```bash
cp proxmox-config/config.example.json proxmox-config/config.json
```

The main sections are:

- `proxmox`: host, port, TLS verification, service type
- `api_tunnel`: optional SSH local forward for the Proxmox API; set `assume_external: true` only when an external tunnel supervisor owns the local listener
- `auth`: Proxmox API user and token
- `logging`: log level, format, optional log file
- `mcp`: MCP host, port, transport, and optional transport Host/Origin allowlists
- `security`: currently includes `dev_mode`
- `jobs`: SQLite path for persistent job tracking
- `command_policy`: rules for `execute_*` tools and high-risk mutating operations
- `ssh`: optional SSH settings for LXC command execution

## Named Targets

For multiple independent Proxmox environments, use the `targets` map instead of the
legacy top-level `proxmox` and `auth` sections. Each target has its own endpoint,
credentials, TLS settings, and optional SSH/command-policy configuration:

```json
{
  "targets": {
    "primary": {
      "host": "pve.example.test",
      "port": 8006,
      "verify_ssl": true,
      "auth": {
        "user": "root@pam",
        "token_name": "automation",
        "token_value": "<secret>"
      }
    },
    "lab": {
      "host": "lab-pve.example.test",
      "port": 8006,
      "verify_ssl": true,
      "auth": {
        "user": "root@pam",
        "token_name": "automation",
        "token_value": "<secret>"
      },
      "readonly": true
    }
  }
}
```

Target names are selected explicitly through the optional `target` argument on
operational MCP tools. Omitting `target` is allowed only when exactly one target is
configured; with multiple targets, the server rejects the request before contacting
Proxmox. Use the read-only `list_targets` tool to inspect configured target names,
endpoint identity, reachability, and discovered node names without exposing credentials.

Named targets are isolated: credentials, managers, SSH settings, command policies,
read-only behavior, and asynchronous jobs are not shared between targets. Do not mix
legacy top-level `proxmox`, `auth`, `ssh`, or `api_tunnel` settings with a `targets` map;
configuration loading rejects ambiguous combinations.

Named targets work in stdio, native MCP HTTP, and OpenAPI modes, including the default
Docker OpenAPI runtime. Generated OpenAPI tool routes accept the same optional `target`
argument as MCP. Direct OpenAPI `/jobs` routes accept `target` as a query parameter and
require it when more than one target is configured; job reads, cancellation, retry,
read-only enforcement, and approval policy are resolved against that exact target.

For an externally managed local API tunnel, set both `api_tunnel.enabled` and
`api_tunnel.assume_external` to `true`. This explicitly tells the server to reuse the
listener without starting or stopping a tunnel process. Only use it when the external
supervisor owns and has verified the tunnel destination; the server cannot verify that
remote identity itself.

## Environment Variable Fallback

If `PROXMOX_MCP_CONFIG` is not set or the file is missing, the loader falls back to environment variables.

Common variables:

- `PROXMOX_HOST`
- `PROXMOX_PORT`
- `PROXMOX_USER`
- `PROXMOX_TOKEN_NAME`
- `PROXMOX_TOKEN_VALUE`
- `PROXMOX_VERIFY_SSL`
- `PROXMOX_SERVICE`
- `LOG_LEVEL`
- `MCP_HOST`
- `MCP_PORT`
- `MCP_TRANSPORT`
- `MCP_DNS_REBINDING_PROTECTION`
- `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`
- `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- `PROXMOX_DEV_MODE`
- `COMMAND_POLICY_MODE`
- `PROXMOX_JOBS_SQLITE_PATH`

## Minimal Local Start

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
$env:PROXMOX_MCP_CONFIG="D:\\PycharmProject\\ProxmoxMCP-Plus\\proxmox-config\\config.json"
python main.py
```

If startup succeeds, the server stays attached to stdio and waits for MCP clients.

## Native MCP Streamable HTTP Mode

Set the MCP transport to `STREAMABLE_HTTP` and bind to an address reachable by the client:

```bash
MCP_API_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 MCP_PORT=8000 MCP_TRANSPORT=STREAMABLE_HTTP \
python -m proxmox_mcp.server
```

The MCP endpoint is:

```text
http://<host>:8000/mcp
```

This is the correct target for MCP clients that support Streamable HTTP. It is separate from the OpenAPI service on port `8811`.

Clients should send `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_API_KEY>`. If `MCP_API_KEY` is unset,
the endpoint remains unauthenticated for backward compatibility and the server logs a
security warning. `PROXMOX_API_KEY` does not protect this endpoint.

For reverse proxy deployments, configure the external hostnames explicitly instead of disabling DNS rebinding protection:

```bash
MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
MCP_PORT=8000 \
MCP_TRANSPORT=STREAMABLE_HTTP \
MCP_API_KEY="$MCP_API_KEY" \
MCP_DNS_REBINDING_PROTECTION=true \
MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS=mcp.example.com:*,localhost:* \
MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://mcp.example.com \
python -m proxmox_mcp.server
```

## OpenAPI Mode

You can run the OpenAPI wrapper directly:

```bash
export PROXMOX_API_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
python -m proxmox_mcp.openapi_proxy --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8811 -- python main.py
```

OpenAPI mode refuses to start without `PROXMOX_API_KEY` unless
`PROXMOX_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true` is set for local unauthenticated development.
HTTP clients should send the key as `Authorization: Bearer <PROXMOX_API_KEY>`.

Available routes:

- `/` returns basic service metadata
- `/docs` serves Swagger UI
- `/openapi.json` serves the generated schema
- `/livez` returns minimal unauthenticated process liveness
- `/readyz` returns `503` until the proxy is connected to the MCP backend, then `200`
- `/health` is a readiness alias for `/readyz`
- `/metrics` exposes Prometheus-style request metrics
- `/jobs` exposes direct job query and control routes when a local `JobStore` is available;
  with named targets, pass `target=<name>` and treat it as required when multiple targets exist

## Docker Compose Deployment

The repository includes `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile`.

Default Compose behavior:

- Builds the local image
- Mounts `./proxmox-config` read-only into `/app/proxmox-config`
- Exposes `8811`
- Keeps OpenAPI mode as the default Docker runtime
- Sets `PROXMOX_MCP_CONFIG=/app/proxmox-config/config.json`
- Requires `PROXMOX_API_KEY` from your shell or Compose `.env` file
- Adds a container liveness health check against `http://localhost:8811/livez`

Start it with:

```bash
export PROXMOX_API_KEY="${PROXMOX_API_KEY:-$(openssl rand -hex 32)}"
docker compose up -d --build
```

To run the native MCP Streamable HTTP service from Docker Compose:

```bash
export MCP_API_KEY="${MCP_API_KEY:-$(openssl rand -hex 32)}"
docker compose --profile mcp-http up -d proxmox-mcp-http
```

Then connect Streamable HTTP MCP clients to `http://<docker-host>:8000/mcp` and send
`Authorization: Bearer <MCP_API_KEY>`.

### Limit the Exposed Tool Surface

Tool filtering is opt-in. With neither setting present, the server exposes the same
available tools as earlier releases. Configure one mode in `mcp`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "tool_allowlist": ["get_nodes", "get_vms", "get_containers", "get_storage"]
  }
}
```

Or select one mode through the environment:

```bash
export MCP_TOOL_ALLOWLIST=get_nodes,get_vms,get_containers,get_storage
# Alternatively: MCP_TOOL_DENYLIST=create_vm,delete_vm
```

Do not configure both modes. If either environment variable is present, it replaces
the file-level filter mode. Tool names are exact and case-sensitive; unknown names stop
startup rather than silently weakening a denylist. A deliberately empty environment
value is supported, but empty CSV entries such as `,` or `get_nodes,` are rejected.
An empty allowlist exposes no tools,
while an empty denylist preserves the complete available surface. Filtering occurs before
MCP registration, so hidden schemas are absent from `tools/list`. The filter also applies
to `list_targets`; include it explicitly when a restricted client needs target discovery.
Allowed operational tools retain target selection and per-target safety checks.
Restart the server and
reconnect clients after changing the selection.

The filter also affects routes generated by the OpenAPI bridge because those routes are
derived from the underlying MCP server's runtime tool list. It is an exposure control,
not a replacement for Proxmox RBAC, API-token scoping, or approval policy.

The same image can also be run directly:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 \
  -e PROXMOX_MCP_MODE=mcp-http \
  -e MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e MCP_PORT=8000 \
  -e MCP_TRANSPORT=STREAMABLE_HTTP \
  -e MCP_API_KEY="$MCP_API_KEY" \
  -v "$(pwd)/proxmox-config/config.json:/app/proxmox-config/config.json:ro" \
  ghcr.io/rekklesna/proxmoxmcp-plus:latest
```

## Operating Checklist

Before exposing the service to users:

- Confirm the Proxmox API token has only the permissions you intend to expose
- Keep `proxmox.verify_ssl=true` unless you are explicitly in development mode
- Keep `security.dev_mode=false` outside local testing
- Set `PROXMOX_API_KEY` for OpenAPI mode; only use `PROXMOX_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true` for local unauthenticated development
- Set `MCP_API_KEY` for every remotely reachable native MCP HTTP deployment
- For MCP HTTP behind a proxy, keep `MCP_DNS_REBINDING_PROTECTION=true` and set `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to the exact public hostnames
- Restrict ingress to networks you control
- Monitor `/livez` for process liveness and authenticated `/health` or `/readyz` for backend readiness
- Monitor `/metrics` if you scrape the service with Prometheus-compatible tooling
- Persist the configured `jobs.sqlite_path` on durable storage if job history matters across restarts
- Store logs somewhere persistent if you need auditability

## Command Execution Features

There are two command execution paths:

- `execute_vm_command`: uses QEMU Guest Agent inside VMs
- `execute_container_command`: uses SSH to the Proxmox node and then `pct exec` inside containers

Container command execution is optional and only appears when an `ssh` section exists in the config.

For setup details, see [Container Command Execution](Container-Command-Execution).

## Long-Running Job Operations

Asynchronous Proxmox actions now register a persistent job record. This applies to operations such as:

- VM create, start, stop, shutdown, reset, and delete
- container create, start, stop, restart, and delete
- snapshot create, delete, and rollback
- backup create, restore, and delete
- ISO download and delete

Operational guidance:

- Treat `job_id` as the stable identifier you hand back to users, agents, and automation systems.
- Treat `task_id` or `UPID` as Proxmox internals that may change after a retry.
- Keep `jobs.sqlite_path` on a persistent volume in Docker or any long-lived service deployment.
- Use `/jobs/{job_id}/poll` or MCP `poll_job` to refresh progress from Proxmox.
- Use `/jobs/{job_id}/retry` only after reviewing `last_error`, `result`, and `audit_log`.

## First Verification Flow

After deployment, test in this order:

1. Start the service and confirm there are no config validation errors
2. Call read-only tools first: `get_nodes`, `get_vms`, `get_storage`, `get_cluster_status`
3. In OpenAPI mode, confirm `/livez` responds and authenticated `/health` and `/docs` requests work
4. Confirm `/jobs` responds if you expect persistent job tracking
5. If you enabled SSH-backed container commands, confirm `execute_container_command` appears in the tool list
6. Only then test mutating tools such as create, start, delete, snapshot, or backup

## Logs and Health

- Application logging is configured under the `logging` section
- `main.py` prints early startup messages to stderr to make bootstrap failures visible
- The OpenAPI wrapper reports `degraded` until it is connected to the MCP subprocess
- authenticated `/health` reports whether direct job routes are enabled in the OpenAPI process
