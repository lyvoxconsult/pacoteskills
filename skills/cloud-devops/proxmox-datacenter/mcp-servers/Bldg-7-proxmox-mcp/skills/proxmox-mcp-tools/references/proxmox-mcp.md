## Overview

This MCP server enables AI agents to manage Proxmox VE through the Model Context Protocol:

- **QEMU VMs**: Create, configure, lifecycle management, snapshots, backups
- **LXC Containers**: Create, configure, lifecycle management
- **Cluster**: HA, replication, migration, backup jobs
- **Storage**: Management, content listing, file operations
- **Networking**: Interfaces, bridges, VLANs, SDN
- **Access Control**: Users, groups, roles, ACLs, domains
- **Ceph**: Storage cluster management
- **Monitoring**: Nodes, services, tasks, logs

## Permission Model

- **Basic**: Read-only operations (list, get, status) - always allowed
- **Elevated**: Create, modify, delete operations - require `PROXMOX_ALLOW_ELEVATED=true`
